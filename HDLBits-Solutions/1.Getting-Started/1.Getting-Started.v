// We're going to start with a small bit of HDL to get familiar with the interface used by HDLBits. Here's the description of the circuit you need to build for this exercise:

// Build a circuit with no inputs and one output. That output should always drive 1 (or logic high).


// Hint>>>  We want to assign 1 to the output one.



module top_module( output one );

// Insert your code here
    assign one = 1'b1;

endmodule
